# BattleShips Web

## Introduction

Collaborating with [Huy], this is our first attempt to build a Sinatra web application. It is also using behaviour driven design plus test driven design, therefore Cucumber and Capybara is being used.

The game is ready to play when theres are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed. By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner. A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placeing each ship from colums A through to E vertically.
